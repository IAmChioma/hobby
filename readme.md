This is my personal hobby project. One of my hobby is playing volleyball and this project models the volleyball game. It includes teams and each team has a country, the year it was established and players. In the game of Volleyball, two teams (with 6 players each) play against each other. The edit pages uses Reactive Forms while the create uses Template Forms
